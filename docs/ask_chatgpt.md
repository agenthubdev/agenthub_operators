# **AskChatGpt**

This class is a subclass of the `BaseOperator` class and declares an operator for interacting with a Conversational AI model called ChatGPT. The purpose of this class is to send a user's prompt or question to the ChatGPT API for processing and receive a response.

The `declar_name()` method returns the name of the operator, which is 'Ask ChatGPT'. The `declare_category()` method  returns the category of the operator, which is `AI`. The `declare_allow_batch()` method returns `True`, indicating that this operator can handle batched inputs.

The `declare_parameters()` method defines the parameters that can be passed to the operator, which includes a `question` parameter which is a string representing the user's prompt or question, a `context` parameter which is an optional string representing the context for the question, and a `max_tokens` parameter which is an integer representing the maximum number of tokens to generate for the response.

The `declare_inputs()` method defines the inputs that can be passed to the operator. This includes a `question` input and a `context` input, both of which are optional.

The `declare_outputs()` method defines the outputs that can be obtained from the operator. This includes a single output, which is the response from the ChatGPT API in the form of a string.

The `run_step()` method is called to execute the operator. It takes in a `step` parameter which contains information about the operator, as well as an `ai_context` object which provides a context for the operator's execution. The method first retrieves the prompt or question from the `step` parameters or from the `ai_context` object. It then retrieves the context from the `step` parameters or from the `ai_context` object. The retrieved context is added to the prompt and then passed to the `ai_context.run_chat_completion()` method to generate a response from the ChatGPT API. The response is then saved as an output using the `ai_context.set_output()` method and logged using the `ai_context.add_to_log()` method.

Overall, the purpose of this class is to provide an interface for interacting with the ChatGPT API and generating responses to user prompts or questions. The `run_step()` method is the main method responsible for interfacing with the API and generating a response, while the other methods provide metadata and configuration for the operator.
