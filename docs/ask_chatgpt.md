# AskChatGpt

The `AskChatGpt` class is a base operator for asking questions to ChatGPT. This class includes methods for declaring the name, parameters, inputs, and outputs of the operator. Additionally, it has a `run_step` method to execute the operator and interact with the AI context.

**Key sections** of the class are:

- declare_name(): Returns the name of the operator as **'Ask ChatGPT'**.
- declare_parameters(): Defines **three parameters** for this operator:
  - `question`: A required string containing the question to ask ChatGPT.
  - `context`: An optional string for providing context for the question.
  - `max_tokens`: An integer specifying the maximum length of the response.
- declare_inputs(): Specifies **one input** for this operator:
  - `context`: An optional string input for providing additional context for the question.
- declare_outputs(): Lists **one output** for this operator:
  - `chatgpt_response`: A string output containing ChatGPT's response to the question.
- run_step(step, ai_context): This method executes the operator. It combines the input and parameter contexts, creates a prompt for ChatGPT based on the combined context and question, runs the chat completion with the generated prompt, sets the output with ChatGPT's response, and logs the response.

In summary, the `AskChatGpt` class allows you to create a custom operator for asking questions to ChatGPT. The operator takes in parameters such as question, context, and maximum token length for the response and provides the answer from ChatGPT as output.
