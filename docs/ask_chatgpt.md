# Ask ChatGPT Operator Documentation

## Summary
A ChatGPT operator used to ask questions while optionally providing some input context, returning the ChatGPT's response.

## Inputs
- `question`: A string, the main question or task to be passed to the ChatGPT model.
- `context`: An optional string, providing additional context to the ChatGPT model to generate the response.

## Parameters
- `question`: Same as `question` input but from the parameter.
- `context`: Same as `context` input but from the parameter.
- `max_tokens`: An integer representing the maximum number of tokens for the model's response.

## Outputs
- `chatgpt_response`: A string containing the response generated by the ChatGPT model.

## Functionality
The `run_step` function takes the input context and parameters, then creates a formatted question by combining both the inputs and parameters together. It then runs the `ai_context.run_chat_completion` function using the formatted question and assigns the result/value to the output `chatgpt_response`. Additionally, the response is logged using the `ai_context.add_to_log` method for debugging purposes.

The helper functions are static methods that declare the properties of the operator, such as name, category, batch processing capabilities, and I/O specifications.
