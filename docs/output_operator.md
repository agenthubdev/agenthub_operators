## **OutputOperator**
This is a class intended to create a named output of a pipeline and store the output of a saved pipeline. It is a special type of operator classified under the `MISC` operator category. Its helper functions serve to declare the name, description, category, parameters, inputs, and outputs of the operator. 

### **Parameters**
The operator accepts several parameters:
- `output_name`: A string variable that gives the pipeline output a name.
- `store_log`: A boolean variable that determines whether the pipeline output is preserved as an Action of an Agent.
- `log_visibility`: An enumeration variable that determines the level of granularity at which the history of outputs for an Agent is stored. It can either be `user` or `team`. This parameter only applies when `store_log` is true.
- `team_name`: A string variable that specifies the team name to store the logs for. This parameter only applies when `log_visibility` is `team`.

### **Inputs**
The only input that this operator accepts is `output`, whose data type is `any`.

### **Outputs**
This operator does not have any output.

### **Helper Methods**
The `declare_name()`, `declare_description()`, `declare_category()`, `declare_parameters()`, `declare_inputs()`, and `declare_outputs()` methods all serve to provide the required information about the operator.

### **Functionality**
When the operator's `run_step()` method is called, it does nothing since the platform on which the operator is deployed implements special treatment for Input and Output operators.
