# InputOperator

The **InputOperator** class is a part of a larger system and inherits from the **BaseOperator** class. Its primary role is to handle a single input value and immediately output it without any modification. 

## Class Methods

- `declare_name()` : This method returns a string 'Input', representing the name of the operator.

- `declare_category()` : Here, the _OperatorCategory_ is declared as **MISC**. This means that the operator falls under the miscellaneous category.

- `declare_parameters()` : The following parameters are declared for this class:

    - name: "value"
    - data_type: "string"
    - placeholder: "Anything you would like this operator instance to output"

  These parameters are used to store the input value that will be directly passed on as the output.

- `declare_inputs()` : This method returns an empty list, as there are no inputs required for this operator, aside from the value declared in the parameters.

- `declare_outputs()` : The output declaration for this operator is as follows:

    - name: "output"
    - data_type: "string"

  This output holds the unmodified input value that has been directly passed from the parameters.

- `run_step(step, ai_context)` : This is the main method of the **InputOperator** class. It receives a step with its parameters and an AI context. The method sets the output value equal to the 'value' parameter fetched from the given step.

In summary, the **InputOperator** serves as a simple input-output operator within a larger system. It takes a single string value as its parameter and immediately provides it as output without any modification or further processing.
