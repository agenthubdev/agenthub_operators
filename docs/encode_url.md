# EncodeURL Operator

## Summary
This operator encodes a given URL string using the `quote_plus()` function from the `urllib.parse` library.

## Inputs
- `input`: A string input representing the URL that needs to be encoded.

## Parameters
This operator does not require any parameters.

## Outputs
- `encoded_url`: A string output representing the encoded URL.

## Functionality
The `run_step` method takes in a step and an AiContext as inputs, and performs the following operations:

1. Obtain the input string from the AiContext using the `get_input` method.
2. Try to encode the input string using the `quote_plus` function.
3. If successful, add a log entry stating that the URL was successfully encoded, and set the output to the encoded URL using the `set_output` method.
4. If an exception occurs during the encoding process, log the error message with the 'red' color.

This operator also includes static methods to declare its name, category, parameters, input and output declarations, and allow batch processing.
