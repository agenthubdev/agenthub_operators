# EncodeURL

This class is a subclass of the BaseOperator class and is used to encode URLs using the urllib library. The purpose of this class is to provide a simple way of encoding input strings to URL-safe strings.

## Class Methods

- **declare_name():** This method returns the name of the class as a string. In this case, it returns 'EncodeURL'.

- **declare_category():** This method returns the category of the operator. In this case, it returns BaseOperator.OperatorCategory.MANIPULATE_DATA.value.

- **declare_parameters():** This method returns a list of parameters that can be passed to the operator. In this case, it returns an empty list.

- **declare_allow_batch():** This method returns a boolean indicating whether the operator allows batch processing. In this case, it returns True.

- **declare_inputs():** This method returns a list of input fields that can be used as inputs for the operator. In this case, it returns a single input field named 'input' that accepts a string as input.

- **declare_outputs():** This method returns a list of output fields that the operator returns. In this case, it returns a single output field named 'encoded_url' that returns a string.

- **run_step():** This is the main method of the class that actually performs the URL encoding. It takes an input string from the 'input' field and encodes it using urllib's quote_plus() method. If successful, it logs the success message and sets the 'encoded_url' output field to the encoded string. If any errors occur during the encoding process, it logs the error message with a red color.

Overall, this class provides a simple and easy-to-use way to encode URLs. The operator input accepts a string, which can be any string, and the output is a URL-encoded string.
