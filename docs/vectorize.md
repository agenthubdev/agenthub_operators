# VectorizeOperator

This class inherits from `BaseOperator` and is used to create a list of elements of size equal to the length of a given vector. 

The `declare_name` method is a static method that returns the name of the operator. 

The `declare_category` method is a static method that returns the category of the operator, which is `BaseOperator.OperatorCategory.MANIPULATE_DATA.value`. 

The `declare_description` method is a static method that returns a description of what the operator does. In this case, it creates a list out of an "element" of the same size as a given vector. 

The `declare_parameters` method is a static method that returns a list of parameters for the operator. In this case, there are no parameters. 

The `declare_inputs` method is a static method that returns a list of inputs for the operator. In this case, there are two inputs: "element", which can be of any data type and "vector", which can also be of any data type. 

The `declare_outputs` method is a static method that returns a list of outputs for the operator. In this case, there is only one output, "vector_of_elements", which is also of any data type.

The `run_step` method takes in two arguments: `step` and `ai_context`. The method gets the "element" and "vector" inputs from the `ai_context` object, creates a list of elements with the same length as the "vector", and sets "vector_of_elements" output in the `ai_context` object.

Overall, this class is used to manipulate data by creating a list out of an "element" of the same size as a given "vector".
