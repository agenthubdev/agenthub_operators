# **GmailSender**

This class is designed to send emails via Gmail using Python's built-in MIME and smtplib libraries. It inherits from a BaseOperator class, which provides some basic functionality.

## Parameters
- `recipient_email`: email address of recipient (string)
- `send_as_html`: whether to send the email in HTML format (boolean)

## Inputs
- `email_body`: the content of the email (string)

## Outputs
- `email_status`: a string indicating whether the email was successfully sent or not

## Methods
- `send_email()`: sends the email and returns a string indicating the success or failure of the operation

The `run_step()` method is the main entry point. It retrieves the recipient email and whether to send the email as HTML from the parameters, as well as the email body, sender's email address and password from the AI context. It then calls `send_email()` and logs the result using the AI context.

The `send_email()` method constructs a MIME message based on the content to be sent and uses smtplib to connect to Gmail's SMTP server, authenticate using the provided credentials, and send the message. It returns a string indicating whether the email was sent successfully or not.

Overall, this class allows for easy sending of Gmails using Python code, with the ability to specify recipients, email content, and whether to use HTML formatting.
