# **GitHubMergeRequester**

This class is a subclass of **BaseOperator** and is used to create merge requests on GitHub. 

## Inputs
- **list_of_diffs**: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains the name and content of a file to be changed in the merge request.

## Parameters
- **repo_name**: A string that represents the name of the repository in the format 'user_name/repository_name'.
- **branch**: A string that represents the base branch to merge the changes into. If not specified, the default is 'main'.

## Outputs
The class does not have any outputs.

## Helper Method
- **create_branch_with_backoff**: This helper method creates a new branch in the forked repository by backing off and retrying the API call if it fails. 

## Functionality 
When run, the class:
1. Requests access to the GitHub API using the access token stored in ai_context.
2. Gets the repository specified in the parameters. 
3. Creates a fork of the repository.
4. Creates a new branch in the forked repository based on the provided base branch.
5. Makes the changes specified in the **list_of_diffs** input by updating the files in the new branch of the forked repository.
6. Creates a pull request to merge the changes in the forked repository back into the original repository.

`create_branch_with_backoff` helper method is used here to poll the GitHub API periodically to check if the fork is ready, and if not, backup and retry the API call again until the fork is ready.

The details of each change made in the merge request are logged in ai_context.

Overall, this class makes it easy to create merge requests programmatically.
