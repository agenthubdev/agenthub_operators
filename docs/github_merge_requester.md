# GitHubMergeRequester

**GitHubMergeRequester** is a class that automates the process of creating and managing merge requests on GitHub. This operator is primarily used to interact with the GitHub API, create forks and branches, and submit pull requests from those forks to the target repository. It has several helper methods that facilitate these actions, ensuring smooth and efficient operation.

## Inputs, Parameters, and Outputs

- Inputs: `list_of_diffs`, an array containing objects with the `name` and `content` of the files to be updated.

- Parameters:
    - `repo_name`: The name of the GitHub repository, in the format of "user_name/repository_name".
    - `branch`: The name of the branch to create a merge request (default is "main").
    
- Outputs: None directly, but the class creates pull requests on GitHub.

## Main Functionality and Helper Methods

- `declare_*` methods define the inputs, parameters, and outputs of the class, as well as the name and category of the operator.
- `run_step` method is responsible for the core functionality of the operator. It processes the given inputs and performs the following actions:
    1. Authenticate and connect to the GitHub API with the provided access token.
    2. Fetch the specified repository and create a fork of it.
    3. Create a new branch in the forked repository with a unique name based on the run ID.
    4. Update the content of the specified files in the new branch with the given content.
    5. Create a pull request to merge the changes from the new branch in the fork to the original repository.
    6. Log the created pull request's URL for reference.
- `create_branch_with_backoff` is a helper method that deals with the creation of a new branch in the forked repository. It handles potential errors by implementing a backoff mechanism, which retries the branch creation process with increasing delays if it encounters any issues. This ensures that the process can recover from temporary GitHub API issues or delays caused by the fork creation.
