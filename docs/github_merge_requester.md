# GitHubMergeRequester

This class is a custom operator that automates the process of creating GitHub merge requests, given a list of differences between files. Key parts of the code include:

- Importing necessary libraries and base classes
- Defining parameter declarations, input, and output specifications
- Implementing the `run_step` function to create merge requests based on input
- Implementing a helper function `create_branch_with_backoff` for creating the branch with retries and backoffs.

## run_step

**run_step** is the core function of the class, responsible for:

- Collecting input parameters and data
- Initializing the GitHub API client with the provided access token
- Forking the target repository
- Creating a new branch in the forked repo
- Iterating through each difference between files
  - Update the file in the new branch with the new content
- Creating a pull request to merge the new branch back into the original repo's main branch

### Flow of run_step

1. **Collect input parameters and data**: Input parameters include `repo_name`, `branch`, and an input list named `list_of_diffs` containing file name and new content for each file that has changes.

2. **Initialize the GitHub API client**: Using the access token provided in the AI Context, the `github.Github` object is initialized, allowing the caller to interact with the GitHub API.

3. **Repository and branch setup**: Obtain the target repo by `repo_name`, create a fork of that repo, and acquire the branch information.

4. **Create a new branch**: Create a new branch based on the run_id, and call the helper function `create_branch_with_backoff` to create the branch in the forked repo with retries and waiting for the fork to be populated.

5. **Update files**: For each file difference (`el`), update the file in the new branch of the forked repo with the new file content, using the `update_file` method and specifying a commit message which includes the link of the runâ€™s URL.

6. **Create pull request**: After updating all the files, the operator creates a pull request to merge the changes in the new branch back into the original repo's main branch.

## Helper Function: create_branch_with_backoff

The **create_branch_with_backoff** function helps with creating a new branch in a forked GitHub repository. This function is necessary because it takes several seconds for GitHub to populate the forked repo, and making API calls before the fork is ready may result in errors. The function takes the following parameters:

- `forked_repo`
- `new_branch_name`
- `base_branch_sha`
- `max_retries` (default: 3)
- `initial_delay` (default: 5)

This function implements a backoff mechanism that retries creating the branch if an error occurs:

1. Starts with an initial delay, which doubles for each retry
2. Adds a small random delay to avoid synchronization issues
3. Retries up to a maximum number of times (`max_retries`)
