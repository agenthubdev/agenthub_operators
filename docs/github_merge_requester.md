# GitHubMergeRequester

**GitHubMergeRequester** is a class that inherits from the *BaseOperator* and is designed to create a GitHub merge request for a specified repository and branch. It takes a list of differences (file names and their content) as input and applies these changes to a new branch created in a forked version of the repository. Finally, it creates a pull request to merge the new branch in the forked repository into the original branch.

## Inputs

- **list_of_diffs**: {name, content}[] – the input data containing a list of dictionaries with 'name' (file name) and 'content' (file content).

## Parameters

- **repo_name**: string – the repository name in the format "user_name/repository_name".
- **branch**: string – the branch name that the merge request will be based on (default is "main").

## Outputs

- The class does not have any declared outputs. However, it returns a log message with the URL of the created pull request.

## Main Functionality

- **run_step**: The main function responsible for creating a GitHub merge request for a specified repository and branch.
    1. Fetches the repository, forks it, and creates a new branch.
    2. Updates the files in the new branch with the new content from the input 'list_of_diffs'.
    3. Creates a pull request to merge the new branch into the original branch.

## Helper Function

- **create_branch_with_backoff**: A static method that helps in creating a branch on a forked repository. If the branch creation fails, it retries with an exponential backoff algorithm up to a maximum number of retries.

That's a brief overview of the **GitHubMergeRequester** class and its functionalities.
