# GitHubMergeRequester Operator Documentation

## Summary
The GitHubMergeRequester operator creates GitHub merge requests for a list of provided diffs.

## Inputs
- `list_of_diffs`: An array of dictionaries with `name` representing the file path and `content` containing the new file content.

## Parameters
- `repo_name`: The GitHub repository in the format `user_name/repository_name`.
- `branch`: The target branch for the merge request (default is "main").

## Outputs
- No specific outputs are generated.

## Functionality

### run_step()
The `run_step()` function is responsible for performing the main operation of creating a merge request. It takes `step` and `ai_context` as input arguments. The function follows these steps:
1. Get the GitHub access token and connect to the GitHub API.
2. Get the specified repository and create a fork of it.
3. Create a new branch in the forked repository with a unique name based on the run ID.
4. Iterate through the provided `list_of_diffs` and update each file in the new branch with the new content.
5. Create a pull request to merge the new branch in the forked repository into the original branch.

### create_branch_with_backoff()
`create_branch_with_backoff()` is a helper function used to create a new branch in the forked repository while handling API errors. It takes `forked_repo`, `new_branch_name`, `base_branch_sha`, `max_retries`, and `initial_delay` as input arguments. The function will retry creating the branch in case of errors, gradually increasing the delay between attempts and giving up after a maximum number of retries.
