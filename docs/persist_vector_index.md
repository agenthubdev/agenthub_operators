## PersistVectorIndex

**PersistVectorIndex** is a class that extends `BaseOperator`. It is used to persist and update a vector index within an AI context. The class performs the following main tasks:

1. **declare_name**: This method returns the name of the operator - "Persist Vector Index".
2. **declare_category**: This method returns the category of the operator, which is "MANIPULATE_DATA".
3. **declare_parameters**: This method returns a list of parameters that the operator takes. It includes an optional parameter "index_id" to specify the vector index id to be updated.
4. **declare_inputs**: This method returns a list of input data required by the operator. It includes a "vector_index" which is a dictionary, without specifying any keys that are expected to be present there.
5. **declare_outputs**: This method returns a list of outputs that the operator produces. It includes the "index_id" of the newly created or updated vector index.
6. **run_step**: This is the main method of the class. It takes two arguments - a step and an AI context. It retrieves the vector index id and vector index from the input and then updates or creates the vector index within the AI context. Finally, it adds a log entry and sets the output as "index_id".

The following are the inputs, parameters, and outputs of the PersistVectorIndex class:

- Inputs:
  - vector_index: A dictionary representing the vector index

- Parameters:
  - index_id: A string representing the vector index id to be updated (optional)

- Outputs:
  - index_id: A string representing the updated or created vector index id
