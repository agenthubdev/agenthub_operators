# **Persist Vector Index**

This class is a sub-class of BaseOperator that manipulates data by persisting a vector index. Its purpose is to publish a vector index to a database and return a unique identifier for this newly created index. This unique identifier can be used by a ChatBot operator to create and run a chat bot. 

The *declare_name()* method returns the name of the operator, and the *declare_category()* method returns the category of operator, in this case, MANIPULATE_DATA. The *declare_parameters()* method returns a list of parameters, in this case, a string type named "index_id" that is optional. 

The *declare_inputs()* method returns a dictionary with only one input called "vector_index", with a data type of dictionary (*{}*). The *declare_outputs()* method returns a list containing only one output called "index_id" with a data type of string.

The *run_step()* method is the main method responsible for handling the operator functionality. It retrieves the optional index_id parameter, as well as the vector_index input from previous operators. It passes both of these inputs as parameters to the *publish_vector_index()* method of the AiContext object, which is responsible for persisting the vector index in a database and returning the unique identifier. After getting the unique identifier, it sets this as an output called "index_id" and adds a log message.

Overall, the Persist Vector Index class provides a simple solution for persisting vector indexes as well as retrieving a unique identifier for the newly saved index. This unique identifier can then be used to create and run chat bots that query this index.
