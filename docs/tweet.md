# **Tweet**
This class is a subclass of BaseOperator and serves to send a tweet through Twitter's API. It contains a method to trim the tweet's length if it exceeds 280 characters, as Twitter's limit for tweet length is 280. 

## Inputs
- `tweet_text`: the text to be tweeted, provided as input by the user.

## Outputs
- `tweet_status`: the status of the tweet after it has been sent.

## Helper methods
- `set_twitter_keys_and_secrets`: This method sets the keys and secrets required for access to Twitter's API. These keys and secrets are obtained from AI context.
- `run_step`: This is the main method that runs the Tweet class. It retrieves the input tweet text, the ingested URL, and the Twitter authentication keys and secrets from AI context. It sends the tweet, logs the result, and updates AI context with the output `tweet_status`.
- `trim_trailing_hashtags`: This method trims the tweet text if it exceeds 280 characters by removing the trailing hashtags.

After obtaining the necessary authentication, the `send_tweet` method creates a Tweepy client and formats the tweet text with the URL. The method then attempts to create the tweet and logs the success or failure of the tweet.

To summarize, this class serves to send a tweet through Twitter's API given an input tweet_text. It formats the tweet and provides the status of the tweet after it has been sent.
