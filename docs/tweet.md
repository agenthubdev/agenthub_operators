# Tweet

**Tweet** is a Python class that extends `BaseOperator`. The main purpose of this class is to send a tweet using the given text and a link from ingested data. Twitter's API and Tweepy library are used to achieve this.

## Inputs
- **tweet_text**: The text that needs to be tweeted.

## Parameters:
- This class doesn't have any parameters.

## Outputs:
- **tweet_status**: The status of the tweet, whether it is successfully tweeted or there was an error.

## Methods:

- `declare_*()` methods are for setting up class metadata required by the running environment.
- `set_twitter_keys_and_secrets(ai_context)` method is responsible for fetching Twitter app secrets and access tokens.
- `run_step(step, ai_context)` method coordinates the tweet posting process. It does the following:
  - Gets `tweet_text` input.
  - Retrieves and set Twitter API keys and secrets.
  - Calls `send_tweet(tweet_text, url, ai_context)` method to send the tweet.
  - Stores the tweeted URL in a memory list.
  The main purpose of this method is to coordinate the overall tweet posting process.
  
- `trim_trailing_hashtags(text, url)` is a helper method that removes trailing hashtags from the tweet text if combined with the ingested url, it is longer than Twitter's limit of 280 characters.

- `send_tweet(tweet_text, url, ai_context)` is responsible for:
  - Connecting to the Tweepy client
  - Formatting the tweet text
  - Sending the tweet through the Tweepy client
  - Handling errors and outputting the status of the tweet (whether it is live or there was an error)

This class is designed to easily and efficiently send tweets with an ingested URL, and managing the formatting and the connection with the Twitter API.
