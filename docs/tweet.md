# Summary

The `Tweet` operator is a class that allows the user to send a tweet with a given text and URL, handling Twitter authentication, and URL formatting.

# Inputs

- **tweet_text**: A string input representing the text to be tweeted. The API will attempt to send this text along with the URL as a tweet.

# Parameters

This operator does not have any declared parameters.

# Outputs

- **tweet_status**: A string output that indicates whether the tweet has been sent successfully or has encountered an error.

# Functionality

- **run_step**: The main function of the operator that fetches the inputs and calls the `send_tweet` function to send the tweet. It also sets the output `tweet_status` and adds the tweeted URL to the `tweeted_links` list in the memory.

- **set_twitter_keys_and_secrets**: This function fetches the necessary secret values (i.e Twitter API keys) from `ai_context` and sets them as instance variables in the operator.

- **trim_trailing_hashtags**: A helper function that trims extra hashtags from the tweet_text to make sure that the tweet with the URL fits within Twitter's character limit (280 characters).

- **send_tweet**: This function consumes `tweet_text`, `url`, and `ai_context` to create a formatted tweet by concatenating the tweet_text and URL with a newline in between. If the formatted tweet is longer than Twitter's character limit, the `trim_trailing_hashtags` function will be called. Finally, the tweet will be sent using the Tweepy library, and the function will return the output status with a link to the tweet if the operation is successful, or an error message if there is an issue with sending the tweet.
