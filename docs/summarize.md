# Summarize

**Summarize** is a class derived from `BaseOperator` and is used for summarizing content using GPT powered by OpenAI. The main functionality is implemented in the `run_step` and `chain` methods.

## Main Methods

### run_step

`run_step` takes the following parameters:

- `step`: Information about the current step in the pipeline.
- `ai_context: AiContext`: A context object which stores data about the pipeline execution.

The method extracts parameters and inputs provided in the pipeline and calls the `process` method to generate the summarized response. The output of the process method is stored in the `ai_context` object and passed on as an output named `summarize_gpt_response`. The method also logs the GPT response using `ai_context.add_to_log()`.

### process

`process` takes the following parameters:

- `params`: Parameters given in the pipeline step.
- `ai_context`: A context object which stores data about the pipeline execution.

The method calls `chain` and passes the required data fetched from the context and parameters.

### chain

`chain` takes the following parameters:

- `params`: Parameters given in the pipeline step.
- `data`: Data input fetched from the context object.
- `openai_api_key`: OpenAI API key fetched from the context object.

The method initializes an instance of `ChatOpenAI` and loads the `summarize_chain` using the provided API key and temperature. The chain is then executed with the given data, and the summarized response is returned.

## Inputs and Outputs

### Inputs

- `rts_processed_content`: The content that needs to be summarized. Data type: `string`.

### Parameters

- `temperature`: A controlling factor for the randomness of text generation. Optional. Default is 0.2. Data type: `float`.

### Outputs

- `summarize_gpt_response`: The summarized content generated by GPT. Data type: `string`.
