# **Summarize** Class

The **Summarize** class is a sub-class of **BaseOperator** and belongs to the category of AI operators. 

## **declare_name()** method
This method returns the name of the operator which is “Summarize Content”.

## **declare_category()** method
This method returns the class category of the operator which in this case is the AI category.

## **declare_parameters()** method
This method returns a list of input parameters required by the operator. In this case, there is only one input parameter named “temperature” which is optional. The “temperature” parameter is a float value that sets the level of creativity for the data summarization.

## **declare_inputs()** method
This method returns a list of inputs that the operator requires to perform the summarization. The input in this case is “rts_processed_content” which is a string.

## **declare_outputs()** method
This method returns the output data that the operator will produce after the execution. In this case, the output data will be a string type and will be stored under the “summarize_gpt_response” label.

## **run_step()** method
This method executes the operator. It takes the input of the current step being executed and performs the summarization process by calling the **process()** function and then sets the output to the “summarize_gpt_response” label. It also logs the response from GPT.

## **process()** method
This method takes in the operator parameters and AI context as input, calls the **chain()** method and returns the response.

## **chain()** method
This method takes in the operator parameters, input data, and openai_api_key as input, sets the temperature of the summarization process, creates an instance of the ChatOpenAI class with the API key and temperature. It loads the summarize chain for synthesizing the text and runs it on the given input data. Finally, it returns the response.

Overall, the **Summarize** class accepts an input text and generates a summarized version of the input text. The level of detail in the summary can be controlled by setting the temperature parameter to a desired value.
