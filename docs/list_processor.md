# ListProcessor

The **ListProcessor** is a class derived from the `BaseOperator`. It is aimed to process a list of elements and to perform a specific action on each element indicated by the user's input through a _prompt_ parameter.

It starts by fetching the list of elements from the `AiContext`. It then iterates through the list, running an AI action specified in the prompt for each element, and later adds the result to a result list which is set as output in the `AiContext`.

## Key Sections

- **declare_name**: Returns the _List Processor_ as the name of the operator.

- **declare_category**: Returns the AI category from `BaseOperator.OperatorCategory`.

- **declare_parameters**: Returns an array containing the `prompt` parameter which is a string type that tells the AI what to do with the list elements.

- **declare_inputs**: Returns an array containing the `list` input of data type `{name,content}[]`.

- **declare_outputs**: Returns an array containing the `result_list` output of data type `{name,content}[]`.

- **run_step**: This is the main method, which takes _step_ and _ai_context_ as inputs, processes the list according to the given prompt and adds the resulting list to the `AiContext`.

The general purpose of this class is to provide a way to process a list of elements based on the prompt that specifies the action to be taken on these elements. The class interacts using the `AiContext` for inputs and outputs, and fetches AI responses for the given prompts.
