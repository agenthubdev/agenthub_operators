# IngestDocs
**IngestDocs** is a class that inherits from the `BaseOperator` class, and its main purpose is to scrape and ingest the content of given documentation. It performs this task by downloading the HTML pages and processing them using the **ReadTheDocsLoader** from `langchain.document_loaders`.

This class has a few important sections:

- **declare_name**: This is a static method that returns a string representing the operator's name, in this case - 'Ingest Documentation'.
- **declare_category**: This static method returns the operator's category, in this case, it's BaseOperator.OperatorCategory.CONSUME_DATA.value.
- **declare_parameters**: This static method returns a list of dictionaries containing the parameters required for this class. The only parameter needed is "docs_uri", which is a string containing the URL of the documentation.
- **declare_inputs**: This static method returns an empty list, as there are no inputs required for this class.
- **declare_outputs**: This static method returns a list containing a dictionary with name "docs_content" and data_type "string". This output will have the scraped document content.
- **run_step**: This method takes in the usual `step` and `ai_context` arguments, and it calls the `ingest` method with parameters and `ai_context`.
- **ingest**: This method takes the parameters and `ai_context` as input, checks if the given URL is valid, and asynchronously runs the `load_docs` method.
- **is_url**: This helper method checks if the given `docs_uri` is a valid URL.
- **download_file**: This async helper method performs the download of a file from a given URL within an aiohttp session.
- **load_docs**: This async method scrapes and processes the documentation from the given URL, saving the data into a temporary directory and uses the `ReadTheDocsLoader` to read and concatenate the content of the ingested document pages.

The class requires a **docs_uri** as a parameter and takes an empty list of inputs. It provides an output **docs_content** as a string containing the scraped content of the documentation. The main purpose of the class is to download and process the given documentation, and its helper methods handle URL validation, file downloads and loading the content of the documentation.
