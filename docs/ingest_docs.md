# IngestDocs

This class is a data consumer that ingests documentation from a specified URL. It uses async networking libraries like asyncio and aiohttp to download all HTML documents from the URL provided using Beautiful Soup parser. The documents are then parsed with ReadTheDocsLoader and their content is concatenated into a single string. This content is then saved to the ai_context storage and log.

## `declare_name`

This method specifies the name of this operator.

## `declare_category`

This method specifies the category of this operator which is data consumption.

## `declare_parameters`

This method specifies the parameters required for this operator. In this case, we need the URL of the documentation.

## `declare_inputs`

This method specifies the inputs required for this operator. In this case, there are no inputs required.

## `declare_outputs`

This method specifies the outputs generated by this operator. In this case, it generates a single output named "docs_content" which contains the concatenated content of all HTML documents in the documentation.

## `run_step`

This method is called when this operator is run as part of a pipeline. It calls the `ingest` method to ingest the documentation.

## `ingest`

This method downloads and concatenates all HTML documents from the documentation URL using asyncio and aiohttp libraries. It then saves the joined content to the ai_context storage and log.

## `is_url`

This method checks if a given string is a URL. It currently returns true for all strings.

## `download_file`

This method is an async method that downloads a file using the aiohttp library and saves it to a specified output directory.

## `load_docs`

This method is an async method that downloads all HTML files from a specified URL and saves them to a temporary directory using `download_file` method. It then loads all HTML documents in the temporary directory using ReadTheDocsLoader and returns the concatenated content.
