# IngestDocs Operator

## Summary
The IngestDocs operator ingests/loads the documentation from a given URL and stores the parsed content as output.

## Inputs
This operator does not have any inputs.

## Parameters
- **docs_uri**: A string that represents the URL of the documentation website. (e.g., "https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/")

## Outputs
- **docs_content**: A string containing the concatenated content of the scraped documentation.

## Functionality
- **run_step()**: This function is the main entry point of the operator. It calls the `ingest` method with the given parameters and the ai_context object.
- **ingest()**: This method takes params and ai_context as input parameters. It extracts the 'docs_uri' from the params and calls `load_docs` method if it's a valid URL. Otherwise, it does nothing (to implement file ingestion later).
- **is_url()**: This helper function validates if the given docs_uri string is a valid URL.
- **download_file()**: This asynchronous function takes a session, URL, and output_directory, downloads the file from the given URL, and saves it to the output_directory.
- **load_docs()**: This async function takes a URL, downloads all the .html files, and loads the content into a `ReadTheDocsLoader`. The concatenation of the content from all the pages is returned.

This operator is utilizing the aiohttp library to perform asynchronous web scraping and downloading of files to provide efficiency in large-scale documentation ingestion.
