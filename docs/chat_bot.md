## **ChatBot**

The `ChatBot` class is a subclass of `BaseOperator` used for integrating a chat bot into a given `vector_index_id`. The purpose of this class is to take a `query` parameter (the user's question) and use the `vector_index_id` specified to search for the most similar chunks from the history (i.e. user inputs) to include in the prompt. The class then loads up to `chat_history_token_budget` (a pre-specified budget of available tokens) of the chat history, along with the prompt, to generate an AI response. 

The `ChatBot` class has several helper methods. The `declare_parameters()` method returns a list of two dictionaries containing the `name` and `data_type` of the `vector_index_id` and `query` parameters respectively. The `declare_inputs()` method returns an empty list, since inputs are not required for the `ChatBot` class. Meanwhile, `declare_outputs()` method returns a dictionary with a single key, `response`, which has a `data_type` of string.

The `run_step()` method uses `get_max_tokens_for_model()` and `count_tokens()` to count the number of available tokens for generating the AI response. It then computes the `context_token_budget` and `hybrid_search_token_budget` which are used for selecting a list of the most relevant chunks. It does this by sorting chunks by similarity and then selecting the most relevant chunks that would fit into the `hybrid_search_token_budget`.

The selected chunks and the user's question are combined to form the `prompt`, which also includes the `context`.

The AI response is generated through the `run_chat_completion()` method which takes in `msgs` (messages exchanged during the chat session) and returns the AI-generated response. 

At the end of each chat session, the `ChatBot` class stores the user's question and the corresponding AI response in the `chat_history_memory_name` specified by the `vector_index_id`.

Overall, the `ChatBot` class is useful in incorporating a chat bot into a vector index search, it produces more relevant responses by including the most similar conversation fragments.
