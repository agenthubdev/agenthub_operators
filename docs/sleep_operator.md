# Sleep Operator

## Summary

The Sleep Operator is a simple testing operator that just sleeps for a specified amount of seconds without performing any useful task.

## Inputs

The Sleep Operator does not have any inputs.

## Parameters

The operator has a single parameter:

- `sleep_seconds` (string): The number of seconds to sleep for.

## Outputs

The Sleep Operator has no outputs.

## Functionality

The main functionality of the Sleep Operator is defined in the `run_step()` method. It takes a `step` and an `ai_context` as arguments. 

The `run_step()` does the following:

1. Retrieves the `sleep_seconds` parameter from the `step`. 
2. Converts it to a floating point number.
3. Sleeps (using the `time.sleep()` function) for the specified amount of seconds.

In addition to the `run_step()` method, the Sleep Operator has several class methods starting with `declare_` that define its properties, like visibility, category, name, description, inputs, outputs, and parameters. These methods are used for operator registration and configuration within the platform.
