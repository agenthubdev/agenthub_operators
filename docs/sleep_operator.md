# **Sleep Operator**

This class extends the BaseOperator class and declares a simple functionality of sleeping for a specified number of seconds. It is intended for testing purposes only and does not have any significant impact on the execution of a workflow.


## Helper methods

- **declare_visibility():** This method declares the visibility of the operator to be "team" and "agenthub".
- **declare_description():** This method returns a description of the operator's function as "Just sleeps and does nothing useful...".
- **declare_name():** This method declares the name of the operator as "Sleep Operator".
- **declare_category():** This method declares the category of the operator as "MISC" within the base operator class.
- **declare_parameters():** This method declares a list of input parameters the operator requires as just one parameter: a string specifying the number of seconds to sleep for.
- **declare_inputs():** This method declares the input requirements of the operator. This operator does not require any inputs.
- **declare_outputs():** This method declares the output requirements of the operator. This operator does not require any outputs.

## Main function

- **run_step(self, step, ai_context):** The method takes two parameters, step and ai_context. Step is a dictionary containing the parameters required to execute this operator while ai_context contains context object needed for the execution of the operator.

    The method first fetches the sleep_second input parameter from the step object and then converts it to a floating-point number. The operator then calls the time.sleep method passing the sleep time argument.

## Inputs

This operator does not require any input parameter from the user.

## Parameters

- **sleep_seconds:** The number of seconds to sleep for.

## Outputs

This operator does not have any output parameter.
