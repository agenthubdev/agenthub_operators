# SleepOperator

**SleepOperator** is a class that inherits from **BaseOperator**. It serves primarily as a testing utility and doesn't do anything useful other than sleeping for a specified amount of time.

### Key Methods:

- `declare_visibility()`: It returns a list with the tuple `('team', 'agenthub')`.
- `declare_description()`: Returns a string describing the class as a testing utility that sleeps and does nothing useful.
- `declare_name()`: Returns the name of the operator as "Sleep Operator".
- `declare_category()`: Returns the category of the operator as "MISC".
- `declare_parameters()`: Returns a list of parameters with a single item for specifying the sleep duration in seconds. The data type for the sleep duration is set as a string.
- `declare_inputs()`: Returns an empty list since there are no required inputs for this operator.
- `declare_outputs()`: Returns an empty list as there are no outputs for this operator.
- `run_step(step, ai_context)`: This method takes a step dictionary and an AI context, retrieves the sleep duration from the step's parameters, converts it to a float, and sleeps for the specified duration using Python's `time.sleep()` function.

### Inputs:
- The class does not require any inputs.

### Parameters:
- `sleep_seconds`: A string representing the number of seconds for the operator to sleep.

### Outputs:
- The class does not produce any outputs.
