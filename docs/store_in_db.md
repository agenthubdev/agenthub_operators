# StoreInDb Operator

## Summary
This StoreInDb Operator stores text in the database by splitting it either by line or by chunks and indexing these chunks based on given parameters.

## Inputs
- `text`: A string containing the text to be stored in the database.

## Parameters
- `table_name`: The name of the table where the data will be stored in the database.
- `visibility`: Determines the access level of the table (user, team, or public).
- `team_name`: The name of the team that will have access to the table, required if visibility is set to team.
- `split_by`: The method of splitting the text into chunks, either by line or by chunk.
- `chunk_size_words`: The desired word count in each chunk, required if the text is split by chunks.
- `language`: The language of the text to be stored.
- `overwrite`: A boolean indicating whether to overwrite any existing data in the table.

## Outputs
There are no outputs for this operator.

## Functionality

### run_step
The `run_step` method takes the input text and the parameters and proceeds to split the text into chunks either by lines or by word count, based on the `split_by` parameter. It then calls the `index_chunks` method from the `AiContext` class to store the created chunks in the database with the given parameters.

### split_text_into_chunks
A helper method `split_text_into_chunks` is used to split the input text into chunks with the desired word count. It first splits the text into sentences and then iteratively adds sentences to a chunk until the total word count of the chunk is as close as possible to the target word count without exceeding it. Once a chunk is created, it is added to a list of chunks which is then returned.
